# NUI

The "No JavaScript" User Interface (NUI) project is an **experimental** web UI library with the goal of allowing developers to create rich, interactive web pages without writing a single line of JavaScript. 

## EXPERIMENT!!

NUI is an **experiment** and therefore:

* Should **not** be used until otherwise specified
